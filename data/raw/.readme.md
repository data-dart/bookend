This is where we'll put the raw data. This data, once added, should not be changed. If we want to save semi-processed or processed data, it should be in a different directory, like `../processed`.

The raw data includes the text samples. I propose we add subdirectories here for each author, e.g. `dickens/` and `austen/`.

We should delete this .readme file once we've added our raw data.
